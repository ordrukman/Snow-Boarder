# Snow-Boarder
A simple Side-Scrolling jumping game using Unity's sprite shape tool.

This project from Udemy course I took is called Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D. I took this course to learn Unity in C# & Code, 2D Video Games for Web, Mac & PC.

Gameplay:

The player controls the surfer by the arrow keys. He must cross the track without overturning which will result in his disqualification and re-attempt.
The game combines varied graphics and effects, visual and auditory when completing the track or the player is disqualified.
Pressing the right or left key will cause the surfer to tilt, pressing the up arrow will cause the surfer's speed to accelerate and pressing the down arrow will lead to a slowdown in the surfer's speed.

This is a fun game that allows the player to perform stunts and flips.
